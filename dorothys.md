### Dorothy's Candies has been hand-making chocolate treats since 1947

Dorothy’s Candies, the bright pink shop Dorothy Gastel started 75 years ago in White Oak, is famous for the hand-dipped chocolates, solid-chocolate Easter bunnies and fruit- and nut-filled Easter eggs that fly off the shelf this time of year.

“I was this tall,” Robert Gastel says with a laugh, holding up his right hand at hip level, when his mom first took him into their McKeesport kitchen to show how to make the  Swiss treats that have thrilled candy lovers for generations.

Dorothy’s mother, Mae Gillespie, learned to make and dip candy during the Great Depression at Dimling’s Candy Co., one of the region’s biggest candy companies at the time. To help support the family during those tough economic times, mother and daughter made fudges, sea foams and other candies in their basement and then sold them door to door.

After she married and had a home of her own in the 1940s, Dorothy continued making chocolates as Christmas presents while her husband, Robert, a milkman at Menzie Dairy, served overseas during World War II.

“My mom was incredible,” says Gastel. “She could do anything with her hands.”

She was so good at molding and enrobing chocolate, in fact, that the year he was born — 1947 — she started a home-based candy business and for the next 10 years continued to sell her treats through a network of  friends and family who served as informal distributors. In 1957, business was brisk enough to move operations into a rented storefront on Versailles Avenue.  

Gastel says his mother used profits from Dorothy’s Candies to help pay for her only son’s education. Robert Sr. had dropped out of high school to help support his family of six, and because she, too, had working class roots, “she was bound and determined to get me through college,” he says.

She was right on the money.

The hand-dipped chocolates renowned for their big chunks of fruit and nuts and homemade fillings not only became a sweet tradition for Pittsburghers but also twice found their way into winners’ gift bags at the Academy Awards. Dorothy's has also served as a chocolatier for the Kentucky Derby.

Business really took off after Dorothy’s moved to the pink building on Route 48 in 1992 and was able to expand its offerings. Around 20 years ago, after decades of closing during the summer months, they began making gourmet caramels, cherry cordials, peanut butter chocolates and other treats year round.

Dorothy Gastel made it obvious she wanted her son to continue her legacy as she got older. He wasn’t so sure, despite being the “chief taster” from age 4. His mother, a perfectionist when it came to decorating and packaging her chocolates in their signature pink boxes, was the artistic one. Her son, with a chemistry degree from Columbia University, was thinking of a more “professional type” career.

He worked briefly as a chemistry teacher at Kiski Prep, and upon earning his MBA at the University of Pittsburgh, became a stockbroker. While he was happy to help his mom mix candy on weekends for the holidays, he had no intention of becoming a chocolatier.

After his mother’s death in 1990,  he reconsidered.  In 1992, Gastel and his wife, Marti, moved the business to its current location in a 13,000-square-foot store and factory at 1228 Long Run Road. He went full time when he retired in 2010.

“It’s part of me,”  he says. “I grew up with it and it’s part of my mother and father.

“I can almost feel my mom in the building at night.”

Building on tradition

Not all chocolate is created equal.  What makes Dorothy’s special is that each piece is crafted by hand, from 10-pound blocks of Swiss milk chocolate, to deliver the smooth, creamy texture that’s a sign of quality.

Swiss milk chocolate was first produced in the 1860s by Daniel Peter, who combined cocoa with the powdered milk invented years earlier by Henri Nestle. It can be tricky to work with, says Gastel, because the cocoa butter crystals in chocolate are sensitive to heat, and even a small amount of humidity can cause problems. It has to be slowly melted and then cooled, a process known as tempering, to get that smooth, glossy finish.

Some candy makers take shortcuts by using vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter. “But if I did, thunderbolts would come down from the sky!” Gastel exclaims.

Like so many others, Dorothy’s had trouble sourcing key ingredients like fresh fruits and nuts and various flavorings during the pandemic. The company also had to resort to plain white boxes instead of the signature pink for a bit.

“It tested him,” says Nan Cohen, who has been the voice of Dorothy’s for years on KDKA and KQV radio.  “If he couldn’t get [his] mom’s recipe, he won’t compromise.”

Customers — many who have been buying for three generations, or live across the country —  know this “and make no bones about changes if they notice it,” she says.

And talk about dedicated: Cohen recounts one longtime customer who drove to Pittsburgh from Virginia to buy a box of chocolate for his mother’s casket. “She had to have her Dorothy’s,” Cohen says.

“It’s tradition,” says manager Marlene Druskin. “We hear people say, ‘Grandma got this for me every year,’ and now they’re getting the same sweets for their own children.”

You can smell all the chocolatey goodness the second you enter the brightly decorated store. Just steps from the counter lies the production room, where some 400 pounds of Swiss chocolate is carefully melted for dipping and coating everything from pretzels to peanut butter to nut clusters and caramels over the course of the day.

On a recent Thursday, Bethany Steiner was busy dipping 1-pound Easter eggs filled with chocolate ganache and potato chips. Hand-dipping often takes years to perfect, but just one season in as a “dipper,” she’s a pro.

After gently placing an egg in her hand, she swirls it around in the chocolate while also wiggling her fingers to make sure the bottom gets coated. She’ll dip it again after it dries on a tray for about an hour.

“I learned on cherry cordials,” she says with a laugh.

Or maybe Dorothy’s is just in her blood: She grew up eating it at home and at her grandmother’s.

Nearby, Rose Schlanger is patiently feeding egg-shaped peanut butter nougat one at a time onto a conveyor belt. As the belt moves forward, a waterfall of chocolate covers  the candy with a thin coat. When it reaches the end of the tunnel, Kathy Kloshen checks for any imperfections; pieces that need retouching get sent back.

Then, it’s on to the packing room to be portioned and boxed by 84-year-old Mary Jane Belusar, who’s been working at Dorothy’s five days a week for the last 15 years.

All the women agree working with chocolate is fun because it allows you to be creative. Often, it’s learn as you go, says dipper Ryan Schlanger, who didn’t know a thing about chocolate when she was hired seven years ago.

“It’s truly an art,” she says. Each type of chocolate, for instance, gets an identifying dimple on top.

“You just have to pay attention and watch carefully, because everyone dips a little different,” she says.

Because they do things the “old fashioned way,” with molds that date to World War II, “you learn things most people could not do,” says Gastel.

Asked if he ever gets tired of chocolate, especially during the busy holiday season, he laughs. He could eat his peanut butter candies every day, and often does.

As for the art of it, he loves that too. Along with knowledge and experience, “it takes heart to be a chocolatier.”
